# My Personal Project

## Phase 0:

### *What will the application do?*

For a UBC student, I believe that every student uses our school's 
Student Service Center (SSC) for scheduling their courses every semester. 
Given the widespread use of the course registration system, I would like to design an application 
similar to the course registration system. This application will list available courses, 
store a student's work-list and registered schedule and show timetable, 
add to wait-list due to seat availability constraints., alert for conflicts, and offer the ability to
switch sections and drop courses.
This application can greatly assist students in the course registration process.

### *Who will use it?*

This application will primarily serve the student community at our university, 
allowing them to efficiently register for courses, 
manage their schedules, and handle wait-lists. 
It will also be useful for prospective students exploring available courses.
University administrators and faculty members can access enrollment data, 
while academic advisors and coordinators can provide course guidance. 
Additionally, technical support teams may use it for issue resolution. 
In summary, this application aims to simulate the course registration process 
for students while providing essential tools for university staff and faculty.

### *Why is this project of interest to you?*

I am interested in making such an application for two reasons.
Firstly, it's an opportunity to apply what I've learned in this course to solve a 
practical problem. Secondly, I'm passionate about helping fellow students 
save time in course scheduling, making their academic lives smoother and more efficient.


### A bulleted list of functions my application will do:
- Store a student's course work-list
- Showing the timetable for registered courses and courses in the work-list separately
- Adding into wait-list.
- Providing course conflicts alerts.
- Switching sections.
- Dropping courses.

### User Stories:
- As a user (student), I want to add a course to my course work-list.
- As a user (student), I want to view all of my registered courses.
- As a user (student), I want to register a course. (Moving a courses
from the work-list to the registered course list)
- As a user (student), I want to be added into the course wait-list.
- As a user (student), I want to switch sections of a course.
- As a user (student), I want to drop a course. (Removing a course from the
    registered course list)
