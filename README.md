# My Personal Project

## Phase 0:

### *What will the application do?*

Given the widespread use of the course registration system in education, I would like to design an application
similar to the course registration system for a course coordinator in charge of many students.
This application will help the course coordinator efficiently register courses for students,
handle their wait lists, switching sections for students, drop courses for students and
streamlining the course guidance process.


### *Who will use it?*

This application will primarily serve our university, specifically for the course coordinators. It may also 
provide essential tools for university staff and faculty.



### *Why is this project of interest to you?*

I am interested in making such an application for two reasons.
Firstly, it's an opportunity to apply what I've learned in this course to solve a 
practical problem. Secondly, I'm passionate about helping the course coordinator 
save time in course scheduling, making their work smoother and more efficient.


### User Stories:
- As a user, I want to add a student to my student list. (I can add as many students as I want!)
- As a user, I want to view all of my students.
- As a user, I want to register a course for a student. (Moving a course
  from the work list to the registered course list)
- As a user, I want to add a student to the course wait list.
- As a user, I want to switch sections of a course for a student.
- As a user, I want to drop a course for a student. (Removing a course from the
  registered course list)
