# My Personal Project

## Phase 0:

### *What will the application do?*

Considering the widespread use of the course registration system in education, I would like to design an application
similar to the course registration system for students.
This application will help them efficiently adding courses to their course work list, registering courses, checking
their work list and registered course list, dropping courses and streamlining the course guidance process.


### *Who will use it?*

This application will primarily serve our university, specifically for the students who need a course 
registration system. It may also provide essential tools for university staff and faculty.



### *Why is this project of interest to you?*

I am interested in making such an application for two reasons.
Firstly, it's an opportunity to apply what I've learned in this course to solve a
practical problem. Secondly, I'm passionate about helping students save time in course scheduling, 
which makes their work smoother and more efficient.
